A cloud service provider can have hundreds of cloud services that are grouped into various types of services. The four most common types of cloud services (the 4 core) for infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) would be:

1. Compute (EC2 Virtual Machines)
	- Imagine having virtual computer that can run application, programs and code.
2. Networking (EBS Virtual Hard drives)
	- Imagine having virtual network defining internet connections or network isolations between services or outbound to the internet.
3. Storage (RSS SQL databases)
	- Imagine having a virtual hard-drive that can store files.
4. Databases (VPC Private Cloud Network)
	- Imagine a virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general purpose web-application.
